## About CCD

The **Center for Collaborative Democracy** is a non-profit, nonpartisan organization that grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program.  

Our mission is to develop innovative methods by which our society can resolve critical problems that established institutions, inside government and out, are failing to remedy.

To that end, we integrate insights from leading thinkers in game theory, behavioral economics and conflict resolution.  

At this time, we are focused on bridging differences among an increasingly polarized and angry American public, creating a shared vision of our country's future, and thereby preventing the breakdown of our democracy. 

To develop a practical plan for achieving that goal, CCD has done extensive research on political adversaries outside of government who have reached agreements that advanced the long-term interests of all sides. We have thereby developed a strategy for generating equivalent results on a national scale. 

We will soon launch a project designed to build broad public support for a combination of widely beneficial, cost-effective solutions for declining social and economic mobility, inadequate schools, soaring national debt and climate change.
