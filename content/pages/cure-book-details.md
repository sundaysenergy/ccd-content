### How to Repair American Democracy

Record numbers of Americans fear that our political process is broken -- for good reason. Our nation faces unprecedented challenges, yet our politicians spend most of their energy attacking one another. All the while, no one in public life has offered a practical way out to neutralize the bitter partisanship that paralyzes Washington.

_The Cure for Our Broken Political Process_ fills that void. The authors show exactly how concerned citizens can get politicians from all camps to negotiate genuine solutions to the most vexing issues. Sol Erdman and Lawrence Susskind base their case on their thirty years of experience in resolving political conflict.

_The Cure_ begins with hard evidence that our country could work out practical solutions to nearly every major controversy that now divides us, solutions that all sides could support. Why, then, don’t our politicians seek out those solutions? The authors debunk all the accepted explanations and then uncover the real reason. By telling the story of a concerned citizen who runs for Congress, the book shows that two basic features of our elections virtually compel politicians to bicker endlessly over national problems. So as long as our elections work as they do today, our lawmkers will keep on fighting, leaving the critical issues unresolved.

The authors then spell out how to redesign elections so that politicians would win only if they produced useful results -- only if they negotiated practical solutions to pressing problems. The book concludes with a step-by-step plan proving that ordinary citizens have the power to bring about these changes. To anyone who fears that our country’s future is in peril, _The Cure _offers a realistic path to a political process they can genuinely believe in.
