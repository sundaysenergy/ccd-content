# Election System Pros and Cons at a Glance

**One-winner-per-district elections:**

  * Each council member represents a neighborhood he/she knows well
  * Each council member represents diverse residents with opposing views and interests.
  * Most citizens cannot get a representative who speaks for their needs and concerns
  * Most citizens don’t see a good reason to vote, and they don’t
  * Most voters don’t scrutinize candidates or evaluate their representative
  * Candidates and elected officials tend to reduce hard issues to slogans
  * Council members often have more incentive to make political opponents look bad than to work together developing intelligent solutions to community problems.

**At-large plurality elections:**

  * Council members tend to focus on the whole community, not just their own neighborhood
  * Minorities cannot obtain representation
  * Voters do not get a specific representative to hold to account for policy decisions

**Proportional representation:**

  * Each group of constituents obtains power proportional to its numbers
  * Voters do not get a specific representative to hold to account for policy decisions
  * Council members often have more incentive to make ideological opponents look bad than to work together developing intelligent solutions to community problems.

**Personally accountable representation:**

  * Each voter gets a specific representative who shares the voter’s outlook
  * Each citizen has a strong incentive to scrutinize candidates, to vote, and then hold their representative to account for his or her actions.
  * Each council member faces multiple competitors at each election
  * Each council member therefore has a strong incentive to reach constructive agreements with opponents.
  * Each council member can explain difficult decisions to constituents in term they can relate to
  * Each group of constituents receives power proportional to its numbers
  * Council likely to deliberate longer and harder — likely to be less decisive — than councils elected by other methods.
