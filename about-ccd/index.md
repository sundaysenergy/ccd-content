## About CCD

The **Center for Collaborative Democracy** is a non-profit, nonpartisan, tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organization. Our mission is to develop innovative methods that will enable Americans of all persuasions to reach agreement on solutions for the most critical national problems.

CCD grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program, which for two decades has helped resolve long-standing political conflicts from local housing battles to worldwide environmental clashes.

CCD has done extensive research on political adversaries outside of government who have negotiated constructive agreements on highly contentious issues. As a result, we have found practical ways to motivate political adversaries inside government to develop equally constructive solutions. 

Our current efforts are focused on convening the negotiators who could best develop a fiscal/economic plan that would serve the long-term interests of Americans in every socio-economic-political category.
