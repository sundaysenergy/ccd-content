## About CCD

The **Center for Collaborative Democracy** is a non-profit, nonpartisan  organization that grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program.  

Our mission is to develop innovative methods by which our society can resolve critical problems that established institutions, inside government and out, are failing to remedy.

Many of our ideas come from our Board of Advisors, which includes leading thinkers in game theory, economics, psychology and conflict resolution.  

At this time, we are focused on bridging differences among an increasingly divided and angry American public â€” and creating a shared vision of our future that includes practical, widely beneficial, cost-effective solutions for growing income inequality, inadequate schools, soaring national debt and climate change. 

To that end, CCD has done extensive research on political adversaries outside of government who have negotiated constructive agreements on highly contentious issues. We have thereby developed a strategy for motivating elected officials to reach equally constructive agreements on the critical issues of these times.
