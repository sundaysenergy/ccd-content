## About CCD

The **Center for Collaborative Democracy** is a non-profit, nonpartisan, tax exempt 501 (c) 3 organization. Our mission is to develop innovative methods that will encourage Americans to participate constructively in civic life and will enable communities to reach optimal decisions on critical issues.

CCD grew out of the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program, which for two decades has refereed political conflicts from local housing battles to worldwide environmental clashes.

CCD has done extensive research on political adversaries _outside_ of government who have negotiated constructive agreements on highly contentious issues. As a result, we have found practical ways to motivate political adversaries _inside_ government to develop equally constructive solutions. 

Our current efforts are focused on convening the negotiators who could best develop a fiscal/economic plan that would serve the long-term interests of Americans across the political and economic spectrum.
