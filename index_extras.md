## Overcoming Gridlock to Build Nationwide Prosperity

We Help Communities Solve Chronic Problems

If your city or town is struggling with a long-standing controversy, CCD can help organize a group of community residents who will be in the best position to negotiate a constructive solution.

If your town council or school board has been struggling with chronic problems, we can help your community reorganize the council or board so that it will be better equipped to develop fair, intelligent solutions.

If you are a member of a city or state legislature deadlocked over a crucial issue, we can help your legislature form a task force that will be in the best position to craft an optimal solution.

We have found that virtually any group of people can resolve a controversial issue by assembling the “appropriate” group of representatives. By “appropriate,” we mean that everyone involved can point to at least one representative as someone they trust to speak for them on the issues at hand.
