# We Help Communities Solve Intractable Problems

The Book Heralding
CCD's Methods

![The Cure Book Cover][1]

The Center for Collaborative Democracy (CCD) has developed leading edge methods that can help your community find constructive solutions to its most divisive issues.

If your town or city is struggling with a long-standing controversy, we can help organize a group of community residents who will be in the best position to negotiate a practical agreement.

If your town council or school board has been struggling with several critical issues, we can help your community reorganize its town council or school board so that it will be better equipped to develop fair, intelligent solutions.

If you are a member of a city or state legislature that  is deadlocked over a crucial issue, we can help your legislature form a task force that will be in the best position to craft a constructive solution.

We have found that virtually any group of people can  resolve a controversial issue if they assemble the “appropriate” group of representatives. By “appropriate,” we mean that everyone involved can point to at least one representative as someone they trust to speak for them on the issue at hand.
