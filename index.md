## A Strategy for Meeting the Challenges of These Times

Politicians who have offered emotionally-charged slogans as remedies for their voters’ troubles — and demonized ideological opponents — have won far more elections in the past 25 years than candidates who offered realistic solutions for our country’s ills. 

Our ills have therefore continued to grow, with the result that 87 percent of voters now worry that our political leaders lack the capacity to solve our major problems, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. 

These worries are clearly self-fulfilling: If the vast majority of us see our elected officials as unable to lead us, they cannot. 

How then do we prevent our country from succumbing to our long-term troubles: income inequality, soaring debt, climate change and voters’ rising contempt for those with different views? 

The Center for Collaborative Democracy has worked with leading experts and thinkers on negotiation, elections, public policy and social trends to develop what we believe is the most practical strategy for unifying all segments of our society around common-sense solutions for our critical problems.
