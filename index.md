## A Strategy for Wide Prosperity, Fiscal Sanity and a Healthy Environment

Politicians who stoke voters' anger about stagnant wages, soaring national debts or rising global temperatures have been winning far more elections worldwide than candidates offering pragmatic solutions.  

The Center for Collaborative Democracy had gathered evidence that whoever wins elections cannot persuade citizens divided along economic, social and political lines to agree on solutions for the critical problems of this era.

We have therefore worked with economists, psychologists, game theorists and experts on negotiation to develop a practical strategy for mobilizing overwhelming public support for common-sense solutions to those problems.

Our research suggests that, in each country, several prominent citizens outside government are eager to solve their nationâ€™s economic and environmental problems, are equipped to work out solutions that will benefit all socioeconomic groups, and have enough influence with each segment of the public to win overwhelming support for those solutions.
