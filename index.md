## A Strategy for Achieving Wide Prosperity, Fiscal Stability and a Healthy Environment

Politicians who offer simplistic or incendiary sound-bites as remedies for stagnant wages, soaring national debts or rising global temperatures have been winning far more elections worldwide than candidates offering pragmatic solutions.  

The Center for Collaborative Democracy has therefore worked with leading experts on negotiation, economics, psychology, game theory and public policy to develop practical steps for mobilizing overwhelming public support for common-sense solutions to the critical problems the major democracies now face.

Our research suggests that, in each country, several prominent citizens outside government are highly motivated to solve their nationâ€™s economic and environmental problems, are equipped to find solutions that will benefit all socioeconomic groups, and have enough influence with each segment of the public to win overwhelming support for those solutions.
